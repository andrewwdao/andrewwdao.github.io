I am a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne in the field of wireless communication, currently focused on Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) and Cognitive Radio. I also work part-time as a Support Domain Engineer at Telstra Ltd., working closely with software development and process improvement for device certification activities.

I graduated with distinction in Master of Engineering from The University of Melbourne in 2023, after receiving a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics from Can Tho University, Vietnam, in 2020.

Wireless communication and embedded systems are among the fields of my utmost interest.

Prior to my role at Telstra, I served as a head technician at the Maker Innovation Space - Can Tho University (MIS-CTU) from 2019 to 2021. This experience equipped me with valuable administrative, interpersonal, documentation, and fundamental project management skills. In 2019, I interned for two months as an Electronics Engineer at Konel Inc., Japan, where I honed my conceptual and critical thinking abilities, applying my electronics and programming skills to design and test a hardware prototype. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my interest and expertise in wireless communication and embedded systems.

My pastimes encompass a diverse range of activities, including swimming and callisthenics, with the soulful sounds of Jazz, Blues and a hint of Rap as the entertainer.

My extensive travels and experiences in nine different countries have not only broadened my horizons but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and a solid adaptability to multicultural environments.

I am eager for any chance to acquire more knowledge and challenge myself intellectually. I would greatly appreciate an opportunity that could help me cultivate and nurture my professional skills in the Wireless Communication and Embedded Systems areas.
